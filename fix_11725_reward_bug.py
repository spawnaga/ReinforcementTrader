"""
Fix the 11,725 reward bug by ensuring the correct reward values are logged.

The bug: After episode 51, portfolio/account values (~11,725) are being logged 
as "rewards" instead of the actual RL rewards (-0.075 for no trading).

The fix: Ensure episode_reward in train_standalone.py contains only the 
accumulated RL rewards from env.step(), not any portfolio values.
