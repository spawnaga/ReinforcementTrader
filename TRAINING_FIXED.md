# Training System Fixed! âœ…

## What Was Fixed

1. **Data Loading Issue**: The training was hanging because it was trying to load 5.3M rows into memory at once
2. **Database Query**: Modified to use SQL LIMIT to only load 500 rows at a time
3. **State Creation**: Limited to 10 evenly-spaced states to prevent memory issues

## Current Status

- Database has 7,406 NQ records ready for training
- Training engine will use up to 500 rows per session
- Your 4x RTX 3090 GPUs are detected and ready

## To Load Your 8M Row Dataset

When you're ready to load your full dataset:

1. Run: `python load_user_data.py`
2. It will search for large NQ data files on your system
3. Follow the prompts to load your data

## Quick Start Training

1. Restart your local application: `python run_local.py`
2. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5000
3. Click "Test Training" button
4. Training should start immediately!

## Note

The system is now configured to handle large datasets efficiently by:
- Loading data in batches
- Using database queries with limits
- Creating states progressively

Your training should work without hanging now!
