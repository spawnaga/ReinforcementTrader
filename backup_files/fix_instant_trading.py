print("""
The AI is exploiting your simulation by opening and closing trades instantly.
This needs to be fixed for realistic training.

## Quick Fixes You Can Apply:

### 1. Add Minimum Holding Period (Recommended)
Edit gym_futures/envs/futures_env.py and add:

```python
# In __init__ method:
self.min_holding_periods = 5  # Must hold for at least 5 time steps
self.holding_time = 0

# In step method, after position changes:
if self.current_position != self.last_position:
    self.holding_time = 0
else:
    self.holding_time += 1

# In buy/sell methods, add check:
if self.holding_time < self.min_holding_periods and self.current_position != 0:
    return  # Can't close position yet
```

### 2. Add Transaction Costs (Also Recommended)
Increase the execution cost to make frequent trading expensive:

```python
# In __init__ method:
self.execution_cost_per_order = 2.5  # $2.50 per side ($5 round trip)
```

### 3. Add Realistic Slippage
Add random slippage to entry/exit prices:

```python
# In generate_random_fill_differential:
slippage_ticks = np.random.randint(1, 4)  # 1-3 ticks slippage
slippage = slippage_ticks * self.tick_size
if direction == 1:  # Buying
    return price + slippage  # Pay more
else:  # Selling
    return price - slippage  # Receive less
```

### 4. Limit Actions Per Episode
Prevent excessive trading:

```python
# In __init__:
self.max_trades_per_episode = 3
self.trades_this_episode = 0

# In buy/sell methods:
if self.trades_this_episode >= self.max_trades_per_episode:
    return
```

## To Apply These Fixes:

1. Stop your current training (Ctrl+C)
2. Edit gym_futures/envs/futures_env.py with the fixes
3. Restart training with more realistic constraints

## Expected Results After Fixes:

- Fewer but more meaningful trades
- AI learns to hold positions longer
- More realistic profit/loss patterns
- Better preparation for live trading
