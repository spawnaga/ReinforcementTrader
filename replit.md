- **Reward Calculation**: Fixed NoneType subtraction errors by adding null checks for entry/exit prices
- **Type Safety**: Ensured all data types are properly converted to float32 before tensor conversion
- **Data Loading**: Fixed DataManager missing method issue by adding load_futures_data() that leverages existing GPU-accelerated loading infrastructure

### Version Control Configuration
- **Added .gitignore**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for models/, logs/, attached_assets/, database files, cache directories, and ML checkpoints to prevent merge conflicts

The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to add multiple trading algorithms, extend to different financial instruments, and integrate with various data sources and brokers.
