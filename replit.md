## Recent Updates (July 12, 2025)

### Bug Fixes and Improvements
- **Training System**: Fixed training stall issue by improving TimeSeriesState creation with automatic timestamp column detection
- **Performance Monitoring**: Confirmed WebSocket broadcasting working correctly, UI elements properly configured with IDs (gpu-progress, memory-progress, network-progress, speed-progress)
- **Data Loading**: Limited states to 100 for testing to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling in state creation with fallback timestamp detection
- **Debug Logging**: Set log level to DEBUG for better diagnostics during training
- **Session Management**: Added automatic cleanup for stale training sessions
- **Data Type Fixes**: Added numeric type conversion for OHLCV columns to fix numpy object dtype tensor conversion errors
- **ANE-PPO Algorithm**: Updated state-to-tensor conversion to handle DataFrames with mixed types by extracting only numeric columns

### Known Issues
- **WebSocket Timeouts**: Fixed by:
  - Setting SOCKETIO_ASYNC_MODE to 'threading' for sync workers
  - Reducing ping timeout to 20s and ping interval to 10s
  - This prevents the 30-second worker timeout issue
- **GPU Access**: System running in CPU-only mode in Replit environment despite detecting GPUs
- **UI Updates**: Performance metrics being broadcast successfully to frontend every 5 seconds
- **Worker Configuration**: Gunicorn using sync worker (workflow limitation) but WebSocket handling improved with threading mode
- **Database Locking**: Fixed by:
  - Enabling SQLite WAL mode for better concurrent access
  - Setting pool_size to 1 for SQLite
  - Adding retry logic with exponential backoff

The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to add multiple trading algorithms, extend to different financial instruments, and integrate with various data sources and brokers.
