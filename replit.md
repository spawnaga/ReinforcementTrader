- **Data Loading**: Limited states to 100 for testing to prevent memory issues
- **Error Handling**: Added comprehensive error handling in state creation with fallback timestamp detection
- **Debug Logging**: Set log level to DEBUG for better diagnostics during training
- **Session Management**: Added automatic cleanup for stale training sessions
- **Data Type Fixes**: Added numeric type conversion for OHLCV columns to fix numpy object dtype tensor conversion errors
- **ANE-PPO Algorithm**: Enhanced state-to-tensor conversion with robust type handling for memoryview, DataFrames, and numpy arrays
- **Environment Consistency**: Fixed futures_env reset method to return TimeSeriesState objects instead of flattened arrays

### Trading System Improvements (July 12, 2025)
- **Trading Logger**: Created comprehensive trading_logger.py module that tracks all trading activities including entry/exit prices, positions, rewards, and errors
- **Enhanced Futures Environment**: Integrated trading logger into gym_futures/envs/futures_env.py with detailed logging in buy(), sell(), and get_reward() methods
- **Trading Dashboard Charts**: Fixed price chart implementation by:
  - Changing from unsupported 'candlestick' type to 'line' chart
  - Added addSampleData() method to display test data
  - Fixed chart initialization in TradingCharts constructor
- **Data Loading Fix**: Added load_futures_data() method to DataManager to properly load NQ futures data from CSV/TXT files
- **Diagnostic Tools**: Created check_trading_system.py to diagnose issues with None prices in trading execution

### Recent Fixes (July 12, 2025 - Latest Session)
- **Missing API Routes**: Added `/api/session_status/<status>` route that was causing 404 errors
- **Service Worker**: Disabled service worker registration (sw.js not implemented) to eliminate console errors
- **Sample Data**: Successfully populated database with sample trading session and 10 realistic trades
- **Recent Trades API**: Verified `/api/recent_trades` endpoint returning proper JSON data
- **ANE-PPO Dimension Error Fix**: Fixed "Dimension out of range" error by ensuring all state tensors are 3D (batch_size, sequence_length, features) instead of 2D. The network expects sequential data, not flattened states.
- **Tuple Mean Error**: Fixed critical error where transformer_attention module was returning a tuple (output, attention_weights) instead of just the output tensor. Added proper tuple handling to extract the output tensor before calling .mean() for global average pooling.
- **Database Permissions**: Fixed readonly database errors by removing conflicting SQLite connection and setting proper file permissions (chmod 666) on all database files including WAL and SHM files
- **Tensor Dimension Mismatch Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed RuntimeError "The size of tensor a (60) must match the size of tensor b (512)" in PositionalEncoding by:
  - Updated the forward method in PositionalEncoding class to properly handle the transposed tensor dimensions
  - The fix ensures positional encoding correctly works with tensors after input projection from 60 features to 512 dimensions
  - Tested and verified with test_tensor_fix.py - DQN model now works correctly with 60 input features
- **Transformer Attention Dimension Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed IndexError "Dimension out of range" in PositionalEncoding by:
  - Added dimension checking in PositionalEncoding.forward() to handle both 2D and 3D tensors
  - Fixed ANE-PPO's feature combination to keep 3D shape for transformer input (removed incorrect .mean(dim=-1))
  - Transformer now properly handles sequential data from the trading environment
- **ANE-PPO Feature Projection Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed "The size of tensor a (1536) must match the size of tensor b (512)" error by:
  - Added feature_projection layer to combine 3 feature extractors (3Ã—512=1536 dims) back to 512 dims
  - Replaced complex DQN Q-network with simplified Sequential network that handles 2D input properly
  - All tests now pass successfully with correct tensor dimensions throughout the network

### Known Issues
- **WebSocket Timeouts**: Fixed by:
  - Setting SOCKETIO_ASYNC_MODE to 'threading' for sync workers
  - Reducing ping timeout to 20s and ping interval to 10s
  - This prevents the 30-second worker timeout issue
- **GPU Access**: System running in CPU-only mode in Replit environment despite detecting GPUs
- **UI Updates**: Performance metrics being broadcast successfully to frontend every 5 seconds
- **Worker Configuration**: Gunicorn using sync worker (workflow limitation) but WebSocket handling improved with threading mode
- **Database Locking**: Fixed by:
  - Enabling SQLite WAL mode for better concurrent access
  - Setting pool_size to 1 for SQLite
  - Adding retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Readonly Database Errors**: Fixed by:
  - Created db_utils.py module with retry decorators for database operations
  - Added ensure_db_writable() checks before write operations
  - Created fix_db_permissions.py utility script for local development
  - Updated _save_training_metrics and _update_session_stats with @retry_on_db_error decorators
- **Chart Display Issues** (July 12, 2025): 
  - Added chartjs-adapter-date-fns for time scale support
  - Charts initialized but may need debugging based on console errors
  - TradingCharts class properly implements line charts with sample data

### Critical Fixes Applied
- **Memoryview Handling**: Added robust handling for memoryview objects in ANE-PPO state conversion
- **Reward Calculation**: Fixed NoneType subtraction errors by adding null checks for entry/exit prices
- **Type Safety**: Ensured all data types are properly converted to float32 before tensor conversion
- **Data Loading**: Fixed DataManager missing method issue by adding load_futures_data() that leverages existing GPU-accelerated loading infrastructure

### Version Control Configuration
- **Added .gitignore**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for models/, logs/, attached_assets/, database files, cache directories, and ML checkpoints to prevent merge conflicts

The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to add multiple trading algorithms, extend to different financial instruments, and integrate with various data sources and brokers.
