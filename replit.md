- **Sample Data**: Successfully populated database with sample trading session and 10 realistic trades
- **Recent Trades API**: Verified `/api/recent_trades` endpoint returning proper JSON data
- **ANE-PPO Dimension Error Fix**: Fixed "Dimension out of range" error by ensuring all state tensors are 3D (batch_size, sequence_length, features) instead of 2D. The network expects sequential data, not flattened states.
- **Tuple Mean Error**: Fixed critical error where transformer_attention module was returning a tuple (output, attention_weights) instead of just the output tensor. Added proper tuple handling to extract the output tensor before calling .mean() for global average pooling.
- **Database Permissions**: Fixed readonly database errors by removing conflicting SQLite connection and setting proper file permissions (chmod 666) on all database files including WAL and SHM files
- **Tensor Dimension Mismatch Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed RuntimeError "The size of tensor a (60) must match the size of tensor b (512)" in PositionalEncoding by:
  - Updated the forward method in PositionalEncoding class to properly handle the transposed tensor dimensions
  - The fix ensures positional encoding correctly works with tensors after input projection from 60 features to 512 dimensions
  - Tested and verified with test_tensor_fix.py - DQN model now works correctly with 60 input features
- **Transformer Attention Dimension Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed IndexError "Dimension out of range" in PositionalEncoding by:

  - Transformer now properly handles sequential data from the trading environment
- **ANE-PPO Feature Projection Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed "The size of tensor a (1536) must match the size of tensor b (512)" error by:
  - Added feature_projection layer to combine 3 feature extractors (3×512=1536 dims) back to 512 dims
  - Replaced complex DQN Q-network with simplified Sequential network that handles 2D input properly
  - All tests now pass successfully with correct tensor dimensions throughout the network
- **SQLite Concurrent Access Fix** (July 12, 2025): Fixed "attempt to write a readonly database" errors by:
  - Updated app.py to use proper SQLite configuration (pool_size=1, timeout=30s, autocommit mode)
  - Created db_connection_manager.py with thread-safe connection pooling and write locks
  - SQLite WAL mode and PRAGMA settings already configured for better concurrent access
  - Issue was NOT tensor dimensions - training runs successfully, only database writes were failing
- **Multi-GPU Support Added** (July 12, 2025): Enhanced system to utilize all 4 RTX 3090 GPUs:
  - Modified trading_engine.py to detect and log all available GPUs

  - Setting pool_size to 1 for SQLite
  - Adding retry logic with exponential backoff
  - Enhanced db_connection_manager.py to automatically fix database permissions before each write operation
  - Fixed permissions for database files including WAL and SHM files (chmod 666)
- **Readonly Database Errors**: Fixed by:
  - Created db_utils.py module with retry decorators for database operations
  - Added ensure_db_writable() checks before write operations
  - Created fix_db_permissions.py utility script for local development
  - Updated _save_training_metrics and _update_session_stats with @retry_on_db_error decorators
  - db_connection_manager.py now automatically fixes permissions on initialization and before write operations
- **Chart Display Issues** (July 12, 2025):

### Version Control Configuration
- **Added .gitignore**: Comprehensive ignore patterns for models/, logs/, attached_assets/, database files, cache directories, and ML checkpoints to prevent merge conflicts

The system is designed to be highly scalable, with the ability to add multiple trading algorithms, extend to different financial instruments, and integrate with various data sources and brokers.
